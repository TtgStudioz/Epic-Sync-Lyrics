      <h2 style="margin-bottom: -5px;">How to use</h2>
      <p>Make sure to enter both song name and artist. If this does not work, double check your spelling and your provided song and artist name. If it still does not show lyrics, the APIs might not have the song you are looking for.</p>
      <p> Keep in mind that this website is far from perfect; some lyrics that show may not be the ones from the song or its lyrics may not be perfectly synced to the song. I am still working on that.</p>

      <p>Shout out to Gani Omyrzak for creating a proxy server for the backup API I use in this project.</p>
